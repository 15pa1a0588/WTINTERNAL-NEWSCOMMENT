<h2>TALKS BETWEEN INDIA AnD RUSSIA</h2>
<img src="talks.jpg" alt="talks"/>
<p>The US cannot expect India to abruptly stop using Russian arms and instead needs a glide path to increase defence trade with New Delhi, a top American commander has told lawmakers.
India is "a key partner and a great strategic opportunity" for the US, Admiral Harry Harris told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during a Congressional hearing.
"Seventy per cent of their military hardware is Russian in origin. You can't expect India to go cold turkey on that," Harris told the lawmakers.
"I think we ought to look at ways to have a glide path, so that we can continue to trade in arms within India," he said.
Harris was responding to a question from senator Tom Cotton who asked about the impact of the recent sanctions legislation (CAATSA) Congress passed, designed primarily with Russia in mind, and specifically countries that continue to use Russian military hardware and systems.
India, a major consumer of Russian arms, is one of the countries that would be impacted by such a legislation.
